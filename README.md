2. The system lists movies available in the given time interval - title and screening times.
3. The user chooses a particular screening.
4. The system gives information regarding screening room and available seats. 
5.The user chooses seats, and gives the name of the person doing the reservation
(name and surname).

3. Screenings should be sorted by title and screening time.
4. There are three ticket types: adult (25 PLN), student (18 PLN), child (12.50 PLN).

Business requirements:
1. The data in the system should be valid, in particular:
a. name and surname should each be at least three characters long, starting with
a capital letter. The surname could consist of two parts separated with a single
dash, in this case the second part should also start with a capital letter. b.
reservation applies to at least one seat.
2. The system should properly handle Polish characters.
 
Technical requirements:
1. Application must be written in JVM language (Java, Scala, Kotlin etc.)
